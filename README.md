Check for New Ohio Liquor Products

I was a little bit of a liquor snob and new products where coming out on the market, but some local State stores didn't carry them.  This program connected to the state of ohio's liquor control website and notified me when the new products came out.

Now I make my own - but this may be of use to another snob out there.  :-)
